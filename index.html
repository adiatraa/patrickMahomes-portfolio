                                    <p id="card-content-p">Born in Tyler, Texas, Mahomes played football, baseball and basketball at Whitehouse High School. In addition to accounting for 65 touchdowns (50 passing, 15 rushing) his senior year, the son of former MLB pitcher Pat Mahomes also excelled on the mound. Facing off against future MLB pitcher Michael Kopech, he tallied 16 strikeouts in a no-hitter.<br><br>

                                        Though Mahomes had committed to play football at Texas Tech, the Detroit Tigers selected him in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft. <br><br>
                                        
                                        In college he played both sports before focusing on the gridiron as a junior. That year, he amassed 5,052 passing yards and 41 touchdowns against 10 interceptions in head coach Kliff Kingsbury's Air Raid offense.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Mahomes was far from a lock to be an early pick, but he decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. A perfect landing spot enabled a seamless transition.<br>

                                <p id="card-content-p">In an age when first-round quarterbacks are expected to start as rookies—sometimes as soon as Week 1—Mahomes watched Smith guide Kansas City back to the playoffs. After essentially redshirting in his first year, he wasted little time rewarding the organization's foresight and patience.<br><br>
                                    
                                    In the first full season as a chief team starter, Mahomes joined Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in a highly exclusive club by tossing 50 passing touchdowns. At just 23 years of age, he matched Dan Marino as the youngest to ever eclipse 5,000 passing yards in a season.<br><br>

                                    The season's overwhelming MVP took his squad to the AFC Championship Game, but K.C. lost in overtime to Brady's New England Patriots. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Following his unprecedented NFL introduction, Mahomes said it was "just the beginning." He's certainly lived up to that declaration.<br><br>

                                <p id="card-content-p">How do you follow a 50-touchdown debut? Mahomes won the Super Bowl.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Though he didn't replicate his Madden-like numbers from the previous season, Mahomes accumulated 901 passing yards and 10 touchdowns with just two interceptions in three come-from-behind playoff wins. With the Chiefs down 20-10 to the San Francisco 49ers, he led them to 21 unanswered fourth-quarter points and the team's first championship in 50 years. He was named Super Bowl LIV MVP.<br><br>

                                    During the offseason, the organization awarded him a record-setting contract extension for $450 million over 10 years. Don't be surprised if he brings more than one more title to Arrowhead Stadium before the deal expires. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Mahomes showed no signs of complacency after getting paid, posting 4,730 passing yards with 38 touchdowns to just six interceptions. With a first-round playoff bye, Kansas City could become the first back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 New England.<br><br>
